  abstract = {A fundamental aspect for building intelligent autonomous robots that can assist humans in their daily lives is the construction of rich environmental representations. While advances in semantic scene representations have en- riched robotic scene understanding, current approaches lack a connection between spatial features and dynamic events; e.g., connecting the blue mug to the event washing a mug. In this work, we introduce the event-grounding graph (EGG), a framework grounding event interactions to spatial features of a scene. This representation allows robots to perceive, reason, and respond to complex spatio-temporal queries. Exper- iments using real robotic data demonstrate EGG’s capability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human inquiries concerning the environment and events within. Furthermore, the EGG framework’s source code and evaluation dataset are released as open-source at: https://github.com/aalto-intelligent-robotics/EGG.},

  abstract = {Modern-day autonomous robots need high-level map representations to perform sophisticated tasks. Recently, 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have emerged as a promising al- ternative to traditional grid maps, blending efficient memory use and rich feature representation. However, most efforts to apply them have been limited to static worlds. This work introduces REACT, a framework that efficiently performs real- time attribute clustering and transfer to relocalize object nodes in a 3DSG. REACT employs a novel method for comparing object instances using an embedding model trained on triplet loss, facilitating instance clustering and matching. Experimental results demonstrate that REACT is able to relocalize ob- jects while maintaining computational efficiency. The REACT framework’s source code will be available as an open-source project, promoting further advancements in reusable and up- datable 3DSGs},
