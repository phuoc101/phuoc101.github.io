Hi! I am **Phuoc**, a doctoral researcher at the [Intelligent Robotics Group](https://irobotics.aalto.fi) at Aalto University, Finland. I am supervised by [Prof. Ville Kyrki](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8OBnyXQAAAAJ&hl=fi&oi=ao) and advised by [Dr. Francesco Verdoja](https://fverdoja.github.io/). My research interests are **Robotic Semantic Scene Understanding, Robotics Mapping and Machine Learning**. My goal is to create representations of our world that enable robots to understand our human-centric environment and assist humans in our daily lives.

Previously, I received my B.Sc degree in Mechatronic Engineering from Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, Vietnam. After that, I pursued my M.Sc(Tech) degree in Robotics and AI from Tampere University, Finland. During my second year, I worked as a research assistant at the [Turku Intelligent Embedded and Robotic Systems (TIERS)](tiers.utu.fi) of the University of Turku. I conducted my master's thesis on a vision-based safe landing pad for UAVs under the supervision of Prof. Tomi Westerlund and Dr. Jorge Peña Queralta. In June 2023, I joined the TIERS team at the [ENRICH competition](https://enrich-2023.european-robotics.eu/) and achieved the best drone 3D map and autonomous exploration of the competition area in the Zwentendorf Nuclear Power Plant in Austria.

Outside of my work, I am a badminton enthusiast and enjoy other sports such as swimming and running. I am also a big fan of anime and manga, and I love playing video games—especially soulsborne games, because I don't think life is hard enough for me ☠️. I love traveling to different countries and discovering different cultures and cuisines. (🇻🇳🇫🇮🇸🇪🇳🇴🇦🇹🇳🇱🇱🇻🇱🇹🇪🇪🇩🇪🇨🇳🇹🇼🇵🇹🇨🇿🇸🇬🇹🇭🇵🇱)
